Welcome to FactChecker_ID, an open-source tool designed to help users verify information against reliable Wikipedia sources. My goal is to make fact-checking accessible to everyone, supporting multilingual functionality in eight languages, including Indonesian, English, Arabic, French, Spanish, Chinese, Japanese, and Russian.

Inspired by the work of https://parafactai.com/, a pioneering platform in this space, I aim to create a tool that is both accurate and accessible. However, I acknowledge that this app is far from perfection and satisfaction, and I'm committed to continually improving and refining it to meet the evolving needs of users.

Empowered by Meta-Llama-3.3-70b-versatile, I operate through GroqÂ®, a state-of-the-art AI inference technology, delivering efficient processing and faster results.

## Advanced Image Analysis

Explore the power of cutting-edge multimodal AI with our flexible image analysis tool. Users can now switch between three advanced vision models:
1. Groq Llama 3.2 11B Vision

+ Lightweight model optimized for efficient image processing
+ Provides quick and accurate visual insights
+ Ideal for rapid image analysis and initial assessments

2. Groq Llama 3.2 90B Vision

+ More sophisticated model with enhanced parameter count
+ Delivers deeper and more nuanced image understanding
+ Offers comprehensive visual analysis with greater depth

3. Google Gemini Flash

+ State-of-the-art multimodal model by Google
+ Combines advanced visual and contextual reasoning
+ Provides unique and intelligent image interpretation

By offering multiple AI models, we empower users to choose the most suitable technology for their specific image analysis needs, ensuring flexibility and precision in visual information processing.

## About Me

I'm Adnuri Mohamidi, a librarian graduate with a strong interest in data and AI technology, and the creator and maintainer of FactChecker_ID. With a background in the media industry as a Reference Librarian, I've developed a passion for using AI to make a positive impact and promoting fact-based discourse.

As a non-developer with a strong interest in AI, I've built FactChecker_ID using Claude Sonnet, a powerful tool for natural language processing. I believe that by working together, we can make a significant difference in promoting fact-based discourse and reducing the spread of misinformation.

If you're interested in joining this initiative, I invite you to contribute to the project by submitting a pull request or reaching out to me directly. Your expertise and ideas can help us improve and expand the capabilities of FactChecker_ID, making it an even more effective tool for promoting media literacy and combating misinformation.

Together, let's work towards a more informed and responsible online community, leveraging the power of Claude Sonnet and our collective expertise to make a positive impact!

### Open to Work

I'm open to full-time or part-time opportunities, both within and outside of this project. If you're interested in exploring potential collaborations or employment opportunities, please don't hesitate to reach out to me cyberariani@gmail.com.

With a diverse range of experiences across multiple sectors, I've had the privilege of working on projects in law, academia, and the automotive industry. Notably, I've served as a Reference Librarian in the media industry, where I provided research support and information literacy training to journalists and media professionals, honing my skills in information retrieval and dissemination.

As a librarian with a strong interest in data and AI technology, I have had the opportunity to explore and develop skills in various areas. With a solid foundation in online research and information literacy, I am well-versed in leveraging digital tools and resources to uncover insights and drive decision-making. My familiarity with AI concepts, particularly large language models (LLMs), has allowed me to stay up-to-date with the latest advancements in natural language processing and machine learning.

I have had the privilege of working on several AI-powered projects, including:

+ https://asksocrates.streamlit.app/:  an application that enables users to engage in discussions with an AI representation of Socrates, a ancient Greek philosopher famous for the Socratic Method. This application replicates his method, guiding users through philosophical questions while challenging their perspectives.
+ https://poetica.streamlit.app/: an application designed to emulate the style of legendary Indonesian poets such as Sapardi Djoko Damono, Chairil Anwar, Sutardji Calzoum Bachri, WS Rendra, and Widji Thukul. This application also provides features for analyzing poetry (aesthetics, semantic hermeneutics, and literary theory), allowing users to explore the beauty of poetry while encouraging new creative expressions.
+ https://pawangdata.streamlit.app/: a project aimed at helping users manage their data in a simple way.

Through these projects, I have gained valuable experience in leveraging AI to drive innovation and solve real-world problems, despite having a non-computer science background. Specifically, I have:

+ Developed a strong foundation in AI-powered application development using Streamlit and other technologies, allowing me to build and deploy applications that integrate AI-driven insights with user-friendly interfaces.
+ Designed and implemented machine learning models for natural language processing and data analysis, demonstrating my ability to apply AI concepts to practical problems and extract valuable insights from complex data sets.
+ Created user interfaces that effectively communicate complex data insights and AI-driven recommendations, showcasing my ability to translate technical information into actionable recommendations for non-technical stakeholders.
